The interest in the freely available statistical programming language and software environment <tt>R</tt> is soaring. By the time we wrote first drafts for this project, more than 11000 add-ons (many of them cutting-edge) were made available on the Comprehensive <tt>R</tt> Archieve Network ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)), an extensive network of FTP servers around the world that store identical and up-to-date versions of <tt>R</tt> code and its documentation. <tt>R</tt> dominates other (commercial) software for statistical computing in most fields of research in applied statistics but the benefits of it being freely available, open source and having a large and constantly growing community of users that contribute to CRAN render <tt>R</tt> more and more appealing for empirical economists and econometricians at the same time. 

A striking advantage of using <tt>R</tt> in econometrics courses is that it allows students to explicitly document their analysis step-by-step such that it is easy to update and to expand. This allows to re-use code for similar applications with different data. More important for the purpose of education, <tt>R</tt> programs are fully reproducible which makes it straightforward for others to comprehend and validate the results. 

Presenting bare <tt>R</tt> code chunks on lecture slides clearly has a deterring effect which is why we offer tutorials where we introduce students to both econometric theory and its applications using <tt>R</tt> for some time now. There are some excelent books that introduce <tt>R</tt> and its applications to econometrics like Kleiber & Zeilis (2008) and Hetekar (2010). However, we think that these works are somewhat difficult to access for undergraduate students in economics having little understanding of econometric methods and predominantly no experience in programming at all. Consequently, we have started to compile a collection of reproducible reports for use in class. These reports provide guidance on how to implement selected applications from the textbook *Introduction to Econometrics* Stock & Watson (2014) on which the lecture is based, using <tt>R</tt>. This process has been faciliated considerably with the release of <tt>knitr</tt>, an <tt>R</tt> package for dynamic report generation which allows to seamlessly combine pure text, Latex and <tt>R</tt> code in a variety of output formats, including PDF and HTML.    

This book is an interactive script in the style of a reproducible research report. **U**sing **R** **f**or **I**ntroduction **t**o **E**conometrics (*URFITE*) aims to provide students of economic sciences with a platform-independent e-learning arrangement that seamlessly intertwines theoretical core knowledge and empirical skills in undergraduate econometrics. Thereby, the focus is set on empirical applications with <tt>R</tt> and we leave out tedious derivations and formal proofs wherever we can. We were inspired by *Using R for Introductory Econometrics* (Heiss, 2016) which builds on the popular *Introductory Econometrics* by Wooldridge (2015) and domonstrates how to replicate the applications discussed therin using <tt>R</tt>. 

Similarly, *URFITE* is closely aligned on Stock & Watson (2014). While the book does very well in motivating theory by real-world applications, we want to take it a step further and would like to enable students not only to learn how results of case studies can be replicated with <tt>R</tt> but we also intend to strengthen their ability in using the newly acquired skills in other empirical applications.

Put differently, this book is neither an introduction to <tt>R</tt>, nor is it intended to be a replacement for the textbook let alone a full course in undergraduate econometrics. Instead, we would like to encourage you to work through chapters of Stock and Watson (2014) and use *URFITE* as an empirically orientated companion to the book.

Throughout this script, interactive <tt>R</tt> programming exercises are used as supplements to code chunks that display how previously discussed techniques can be implemented within <tt>R</tt>. These programming exercises are realized using the [DataCamp light widget](https://github.com/datacamp/datacamp-light) and are backed by an <tt>R</tt>-session which is maintained on DataCamp's servers. 

The widget consists of two tabs. <tt>script.R</tt> mimics a <tt>.R</tt>-file, a file format that is commonly used for storing <tt>R</tt> code. Lines starting with a <tt>#</tt> are commented out, that is they are not recognized as code. Furthermore, <tt>script.R</tt> works like an exercise sheet where you may write down the solution you come up with. If you hit the button <tt>run</tt>, submission correctness tests are run and you will be notified whether your approach is correct. If not, you will receive feedback suggesting improvements or hints. The other tab, <tt>R Console</tt>, is a fully functional <tt>R</tt> console that can be used for trying out solutions to exercises before submitting them. Of course you may submit (almost any) arbitrary <tt>R</tt> code and use the console to play around and explore. Simply type a command and hit the enter key on your keyboard.

As an example, the line of code presented in the code chunk below tells <tt>R</tt> to compute the number of packages available on <tt>CRAN</tt>.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
nrow(available.packages())
```

You may click on <tt>R Console</tt>, enter and execute this command (the <tt>R</tt> session is initialized by clicking anywhere into the widget. This might take a few seconds.)
