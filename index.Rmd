# Preface

#### What this book is (and what it is not) {-}

This book is an interactive script in the style of a reproducible research report. <b>U</b>sing <b>R</b> for <b>I</b>ntroduction to <b>E</b>conometrics (*URFITE*) aims to provide students of economic sciences with a platform-independent e-learning arrangement that seamlessly intertwines theoretical core knowledge and empirical skills in undergraduate econometrics. Thereby, we set the focus on empirical applications with the freely available statistical software package <tt>R</tt> and leave out tedious derivations and formal proofs. 

*URFITE* is aligned on *Introduction to Econometrics* (Stock and Watson, 2014), a standard textbook in introductory econometrics. While the book does very well in motivating theory by real-world applications, we want to take it a step further and enable students not only to learn how to reproduce results of case studies with <tt>R</tt> but also to strengthen their ability to use the newly acquired skills in other empirical applications.<br>

However, this book is neither an introduction to <tt>R</tt>, nor is it indended to be a replacement for the textbook let alone a full course in econometrics.
