["index.html", "Using R for Introduction to Econometrics 1 Preface", " Using R for Introduction to Econometrics Christoph Hanck, Martin Arnold, Alexander Gerber and Martin Schmelzer 2017-10-08 1 Preface What this book is (and what it is not) This book is an interactive script aiming to provide students of economic sciences with a platform-independent E-learning arrangement that seamlessly intertwines both, teaching of theoretical core concepts and empirical skills in undergraduate econometrics. Thereby, the focus clearly lays on empirical applications with the freely available statistical software package R. The script is aligned on Introduction to Econometrics (Stock and Watson, 2014), a standard textbook in introductory econometrics. While the book does well in motivating theory by real-world applications, we want to take it a step further and intend to enable students not only to learn how to reproduce results of case studies with R but also to strengthen their ability to use these newly acquired skills in other empirical applications. Therefore, this book is neither an introduction to R, nor is it indended to be a replacement for the textbook let alone a full course in econometrics. "]
