The interest in the freely available statistical programming language and software environment <tt>R</tt> is soaring. By the time we wrote first drafts for this project, more than 11000 add-ons (many of them providing cutting-edge methods) were made available on the Comprehensive <tt>R</tt> Archieve Network ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)), an extensive network of FTP servers around the world that store identical and up-to-date versions of <tt>R</tt> code and its documentation. <tt>R</tt> dominates other (commercial) software for statistical computing in most fields of research in applied statistics but the benefits of it being freely available, open source and having a large and constantly growing community of users that contribute to CRAN render <tt>R</tt> more and more appealing for empirical economists and econometricians at the same time. 

A striking advantage of using <tt>R</tt> in econometrics courses is that it enables students to explicitly document their analysis step-by-step such that it is easy to update and to expand. This allows to re-use code for similar applications with different data. Furthermore, <tt>R</tt> programs are fully reproducible which makes it straightforward for others to comprehend and validate the results. 

Thus, over the recent years, <tt>R</tt> has become an integral part of the curricula of econometrics classes we teach at University of Duisburg-Essen. In some sense, learning to code is comparable to learning a foreign language and continuous practice is essential for the learning success. Of course, presenting bare <tt>R</tt> code chunks on slides has mostly a deterring effect for the students to engange with programming on their own. This is why we offer tutorials where both econometric theory and its applications using <tt>R</tt> are introduced, for some time now. As for accompanying literature, there are some excelent books that deal with <tt>R</tt> and its applications to econometrics like Kleiber & Zeilis (2008) and Hetekar (2010). However, we have found that these works are somewhat difficult to access, especially for undergraduate students in economics having little understanding of econometric methods and predominantly no experience in programming at all. Consequently, we have started to compile a collection of reproducible reports for use in class. These reports provide guidance on how to implement selected applications from the textbook *Introduction to Econometrics* by Stock & Watson (2014) which serves as a basis for the lecture and the accompanying tutorials. The process has been faciliated considerably with the release of <tt>knitr</tt> (2018), an <tt>R</tt> package for dynamic report generation which allows to seamlessly combine pure text, $\LaTeX$, <tt>R</tt> code and its output in a variety of formats, including PDF and HTML. Being inspired by *Using R for Introductory Econometrics* (Heiss, 2016)^[This textbook builds on the popular *Introductory Econometrics* by Wooldridge (2015) and domonstrates how to replicate the applications discussed therin using <tt>R</tt>.] and with this powerful toolkit at hand we decided to write up our own empirical companion to Stock & Watson (2014) which resulted in **U**sing **R** **f**or **I**ntroduction **t**o **E**conometrics (*URFITE*). 


Similarly as Heiss (2016) this project is neither a comprehensive econometrics textbook nor is it intended to be a general introduction <tt>R</tt>. *URFITE* is best described as an interactive script in the style of a reproducible research report which aims to provide students of economic sciences with a platform-independent e-learning arrangement by seamlessly intertwining theoretical core knowledge and empirical skills in undergraduate econometrics. The focus is set on empirical applications with <tt>R</tt> so we leave out tedious derivations and formal proofs wherever we can. *URFITE* is closely aligned on Stock & Watson (2014) which does very well in motivating theory by real-world applications. However, we take it a step further and enable students not only to learn how results of case studies can be replicated with <tt>R</tt> but we also to strengthen their ability in using the newly acquired skills in other empirical applications. To support this, each chapter contains interactive <tt>R</tt> programming exercises. These exercises are used as supplements to code chunks that display how previously discussed techniques can be implemented within <tt>R</tt>. They are generated using the [DataCamp light widget](https://github.com/datacamp/datacamp-light) and are backed by an <tt>R</tt>-session which is maintained on DataCamp's servers. You may play around with the example exercise presented below.

<!--html_preserve-->

<div data-datacamp-exercise data-lang="r">

	<code data-type="sample-code">
		# Create a variable a, equal to 5

		# Print out a
		
		# check the number of R packages available on CRAN

	</code>
	
	<code data-type="solution">
		# Create a variable a, equal to 5
		a <- 5

		# Print out a
		print(a)
	</code>
	
	<code data-type="sct">
		test_object("a")
		test_function("print")
		test_function("nrow")
		test_function("available.packages")
		success_msg("Great job!")
	</code>
	
	<div data-type="hint">
	Use the assignment operator (<code> <- </code>) to create the variable <code>a</code>.
	</div>

</div>

The widget consists of two tabs. <tt>script.R</tt> mimics a <tt>.R</tt>-file, a file format that is commonly used for storing <tt>R</tt> code. Lines starting with a <tt>#</tt> are commented out, that is they are not recognized as code. Furthermore, <tt>script.R</tt> works like an exercise sheet where you may write down the solution you come up with. If you hit the button <tt>run</tt>, submission correctness tests are run and you will be notified whether your approach is correct. If not, you will receive feedback suggesting improvements or hints. The other tab, <tt>R Console</tt>, is a fully functional <tt>R</tt> console that can be used for trying out solutions to exercises before submitting them. Of course you may submit (almost any) arbitrary <tt>R</tt> code and use the console to play around and explore. Simply type a command and hit the enter key on your keyboard.

As an example consider the following:
The line of code presented in the code chunk below tells <tt>R</tt> to compute the number of packages available on <tt>CRAN</tt>. It is followed by the output produced.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# compute the number of packages available on CRAN
nrow(available.packages())
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# compute the number of packages available on CRAN
nrow(available.packages(repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org"))
```

Each code chunk is equipped with a button on the outer right hand side which copies the code to your clipboard. This makes it convenient to work with larger code segments. In the widget above, you may click on <tt>R Console</tt> and type `nrow(available.packages())` (the command from the code chunk above) and execute it by hitting *enter* on your keyboard (the <tt>R</tt> session is initialized by clicking anywhere into the widget. This might take a few seconds. Just wait for the indicator next to the run button to turn green). 

As you might have noticed, there are some out-commented lines in the widget that ask you to assign a numeric value to a variable and then to print the variable's content to the console. You may enter your solution approach to <tt>script.R</tt> and hit the botton *run* in order to get the feedback described further above. In case you do not know how to solve this sample exercise (don't panic, that is probably why you are reading this), a click on *hint* will prompt you with some advice. If you still can't find a solution, a click on *solution* will provide you with another tab, <tt>Solution.R</tt> which contains sample solution code. It will often be the case that exercises can be solved in many different ways and <tt>Solution.R</tt> presents what we consider as comprehensible and idiomatic.
