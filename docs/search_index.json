Using R for Introduction to Econometrics (URFITE) aims to provide students of economic sciences with a platform-independent e-learning arrangement that seamlessly intertwines theoretical core knowledge and empirical skills in undergraduate econometrics. Thereby, we set the focus on empirical applications with the freely available statistical software package R and leave out tedious derivations and formal proofs. URFITE is aligned on Introduction to Econometrics (Stock and Watson, 2014), a standard textbook in introductory econometrics. While the book does very well in motivating theory by real-world applications, we want to take it a step further and enable students not only to learn how to reproduce results of case studies with R but also to strengthen their ability to use the newly acquired skills in other empirical applications. However, this book is neither an introduction to R, nor is it intended to be a replacement for the textbook let alone a full course in econometrics. Throughout the book interactive R programming exercises are # This will get executed each time the exercise gets initialized b = 6 # Create a variable a, equal to 5 # Print out a # Create a variable a, equal to 5 a test_object(\"a\") test_function(\"print\") success_msg(\"Great job!\") Use the assignment operator ( ) to create the variable a.
