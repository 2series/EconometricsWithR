Using R for Introduction to Econometrics (URFITE) aims to provide students of economic sciences with a platform-independent e-learning arrangement that seamlessly intertwines theoretical core knowledge and empirical skills in undergraduate econometrics. Thereby, the focus is set on empirical applications with the freely available statistical software package R. We leave out tedious derivations and formal proofs. URFITE is closely aligned on Introduction to Econometrics (Stock and Watson, 2014), a standard textbook in introductory econometrics. While the book does very well in motivating theory by real-world applications, we want to take it a step further and would like to enable students not only to learn how results of case studies can be replicated with R but also indent to strengthen their ability in using the newly acquired skills in other empirical applications. However, this book is neither an introduction to R, nor is it intended to be a replacement for the textbook let alone a full course in econometrics. Throughout the book, interactive R programming exercises are used as supplements to code chunks that display how previously discussed techniques can be implemented within R. These programming exercises are realized using the DataCamp light widget and are backed by an R-session which is maintained on DataCampâ€™s servers. The R session is initialized by clicking into the widget. This might take a few seconds. You can try that below. # This will get executed each time the exercise gets initialized b = 6 # Create a variable a, equal to 5 # Print out a # Create a variable a, equal to 5 a test_object(\"a\") test_function(\"print\") success_msg(\"Great job!\") Use the assignment operator ( ) to create the variable a.
