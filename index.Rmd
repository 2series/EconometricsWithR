This book is an interactive script in the style of a reproducible research report. <b>U</b>sing <b>R</b> for <b>I</b>ntroduction to <b>E</b>conometrics (*URFITE*) aims to provide students of economic sciences with a platform-independent e-learning arrangement that seamlessly intertwines theoretical core knowledge and empirical skills in undergraduate econometrics. Thereby, the focus is set on empirical applications with the freely available statistical software package <tt>R</tt> and we leave out tedious derivations and formal proofs. 

*URFITE* is closely aligned on *Introduction to Econometrics* (Stock and Watson, 2014), a standard textbook in introductory econometrics. While the book does very well in motivating theory by real-world applications, we want to take it a step further and would like to enable you not only to learn how results of case studies can be replicated with <tt>R</tt> but we also indent to strengthen your ability in using the newly acquired skills in other empirical applications.

Put differently, this book is neither an introduction to <tt>R</tt>, nor is it intended to be a replacement for the textbook let alone a full course in undergraduate econometrics. Instead, we would like to encourage you to work through chapters of Stock and Watson (2014) and use *URFITE* as an empirically orientated companion to the book.

Throughout this script, interactive <tt>R</tt> programming exercises are used as supplements to code chunks that display how previously discussed techniques can be implemented within <tt>R</tt>. These programming exercises are realized using the [DataCamp light widget](https://github.com/datacamp/datacamp-light) and are backed by an <tt>R</tt>-session which is maintained on DataCamp's servers. The <tt>R</tt> session is initialized by clicking into the widget. This might take a few seconds (you can try that below).

The tab <tt>script.R</tt> mimics a <tt>.R</tt>-file, a file format that is commonly used for storing <tt>R</tt> code. Lines starting with a <tt>#</tt> are commented out, that is they are not recognised as code. Furthermore, <tt>script.R</tt> works like an exercise sheet where you may write down the solution you come up with. If you hit the button <tt>run</tt>, submission correctness tests are run and you will be notified whether your approach is correct. If not, you will recieve feedback suggesting improvements or hints.

<tt>R Console</tt> is a fully functional <tt>R</tt> console that can be used for trying out solutions to exercises before submitting them. Of course you may submit (almost any) arbitrary <tt>R</tt> code and use the console to play around and explore. Simply type a command and hit the enter key on your keyboard.
