Using R for Introduction to Econometrics (URFITE) aims to provide students of economic sciences with a platform-independent e-learning arrangement that seamlessly intertwines theoretical core knowledge and empirical skills in undergraduate econometrics. Thereby, the focus is set on empirical applications with the freely available statistical software package R and we leave out tedious derivations and formal proofs. URFITE is closely aligned on Introduction to Econometrics (Stock and Watson, 2014), a standard textbook in introductory econometrics. While the book does very well in motivating theory by real-world applications, we want to take it a step further and would like to enable you not only to learn how results of case studies can be replicated with R but we also indent to strengthen your ability in using the newly acquired skills in other empirical applications. Put differently, this book is neither an introduction to R, nor is it intended to be a replacement for the textbook let alone a full course in undergraduate econometrics. Instead, we would like to encourage you to work through chapters of Stock and Watson (2014) and use URFITE as an empirically orientated companion to the book. Throughout this script, interactive R programming exercises are used as supplements to code chunks that display how previously discussed techniques can be implemented within R. These programming exercises are realized using the DataCamp light widget and are backed by an R-session which is maintained on DataCampâ€™s servers. The R session is initialized by clicking into the widget. This might take a few seconds (you can try that below). # This will get executed each time the exercise gets initialized b = 6 # Create a variable a, equal to 5 # Print out a # Create a variable a, equal to 5 a test_object(\"a\") test_function(\"print\") success_msg(\"Great job!\") Use the assignment operator ( ) to create the variable a. The tab script.R mimics a .R-file, a file format that is commonly used for storing R code. Lines starting with a # are commented out, that is they are not recognised as code. Furthermore, script.R works like an exercise sheet where you may write down the solution you come up with. If you hit the button run, submission correctness tests are run and you will be notified whether your approach is correct. If not, you will recieve feedback suggesting improvements or hints. R Console is a fully functional R console that can be used for trying out solutions to exercises before submitting them. Of course you may submit (almost any) arbitrary R code and use the console to play around and explore. Simply type a command and hit the enter key on your keyboard. "]
