The interest in the freely available statistical programming language and software environment `r ttcode("R")` is soaring. By the time we wrote first drafts for this project, more than 11000 addons (many of them providing cutting-edge methods) were made available on the Comprehensive `r ttcode("R")` Archive Network ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)), an extensive network of FTP servers around the world that store identical and up-to-date versions of `r ttcode("R")` code and its documentation. `r ttcode("R")` dominates other (commercial) software for statistical computing in most fields of research in applied statistics. The benefits of it being freely available, open source and having a large and constantly growing community of users that contribute to CRAN render `r ttcode("R")` more and more appealing for empirical economists and econometricians as well. 

A striking advantage of using `r ttcode("R")` in econometrics courses is that it enables students to explicitly document their analysis step-by-step such that it is easy to update and to expand. This allows to re-use code for similar applications with different data. Furthermore, `r ttcode("R")` programs are fully reproducible which makes it straightforward for others to comprehend and validate results. 

Over the recent years, `r ttcode("R")` has thus become an integral part of the curricula of econometrics classes we teach at University of Duisburg-Essen. In some sense, learning to code is comparable to learning a foreign language and continuous practice is essential for the learning success. Of course, presenting bare `r ttcode("R")` code chunks on slides has mostly a deterring effect for the students to engage with programming on their own. This is why we offer tutorials where both econometric theory and its applications using `r ttcode("R")` are introduced, for some time now. As for accompanying literature, there are some excellent books that deal with `r ttcode("R")` and its applications to econometrics like @kleiber2008. However, we have found that these works are somewhat difficult to access, especially for undergraduate students in economics having little understanding of econometric methods and predominantly no experience in programming at all. Consequently, we have started to compile a collection of reproducible reports for use in class. These reports provide guidance on how to implement selected applications from the textbook *Introduction to Econometrics* [@stock2015] which serves as a basis for the lecture and the accompanying tutorials. The process has been facilitated considerably with the release of `r ttcode("knitr")` (2018). `r ttcode("knitr")` is  an `r ttcode("R")` package for dynamic report generation which allows to seamlessly combine pure text, LaTeX, `r ttcode("R")` code and its output in a variety of formats, including PDF and HTML. Being inspired by *Using R for Introductory Econometrics* [@heiss2016]^[@heiss2016 builds on the popular *Introductory Econometrics* by @wooldridge2016 and demonstrates how to replicate the applications discussed therein using `r ttcode("R")`.] and with this powerful toolkit at hand we decided to write up our own empirical companion to @stock2015 which resulted in **U**sing **R** **f**or **I**ntroduction **t**o **E**conometrics (*URFITE*). 

Similarly to the book by @heiss2016 this project is neither a comprehensive econometrics textbook nor is it intended to be a general introduction `r ttcode("R")`. *URFITE* is best described as an interactive script in the style of a reproducible research report which aims to provide students of economic sciences with a platform-independent e-learning arrangement by seamlessly intertwining theoretical core knowledge and empirical skills in undergraduate econometrics. Of course the focus is set on empirical applications with `r ttcode("R")`; we leave out tedious derivations and formal proofs wherever we can. *URFITE* is closely aligned on @stock2015 which does very well in motivating theory by real-world applications. However, we take it a step further and enable students not only to learn how results of case studies can be replicated with `r ttcode("R")` but we also intend to strengthen their ability in using the newly acquired skills in other empirical applications. To support this, each chapter contains interactive `r ttcode("R")` programming exercises. These exercises are used as supplements to code chunks that display how previously discussed techniques can be implemented within `r ttcode("R")`. They are generated using the [DataCamp light widget](https://github.com/datacamp/datacamp-light) and are backed by an `r ttcode("R")`-session which is maintained on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/home)'s servers. You may play around with the example exercise presented below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
if (my_output=="html"){
  cat('
<!--html_preserve-->

<div data-datacamp-exercise data-lang="r">

	<code data-type="sample-code">
		# Create a variable a, equal to 5

		# Print out a
		
		# check the number of R packages available on CRAN

	</code>
	
	<code data-type="solution">
		# Create a variable a, equal to 5
		a <- 5

		# Print out a
		print(a)
	</code>
	
	<code data-type="sct">
		test_object("a")
		test_function("print")
		test_function("nrow")
		test_function("available.packages")
		success_msg("Great job!")
	</code>
	
	<div data-type="hint">
	Use the assignment operator (<code> <- </code>) to create the variable <code>a</code>.
	</div>

</div>

<!--/html_preserve-->')
} else {
  cat('\\begin{center}\\textit{This interactive application is only available in the HTML version.}\\end{center}')
}  
```

As you can see above, the widget consists of two tabs. `r ttcode("script.R")` mimics an `r ttcode(".R")`-file, a file format that is commonly used for storing `r ttcode("R")` code. Lines starting with a # are commented out, that is they are not recognized as code. Furthermore, `r ttcode("script.R")` works like an exercise sheet where you may write down the solution you come up with. If you hit the button *Run*, the code will be executed, submission correctness tests are run and you will be notified whether your approach is correct. If it is not correct, you will receive feedback suggesting improvements or hints. The other tab, `r ttcode("R Console")`, is a fully functional `r ttcode("R")` console that can be used for trying out solutions to exercises before submitting them. Of course you may submit (almost any) arbitrary `r ttcode("R")` code and use the console to play around and explore. Simply type a command and hit the enter key on your keyboard.

As an example, consider the following line of code presented in chunk below. It tells `r ttcode("R")` to compute the number of packages available on `r ttcode("CRAN")`. The code chunk is followed by the output produced.

```{r}
# compute the number of packages available on CRAN
nrow(available.packages(repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org"))
```

Each code chunk is equipped with a button on the outer right hand side which copies the code to your clipboard. This makes it convenient to work with larger code segments. In the widget above, you may click on `r ttcode("R Console")` and type `nrow(available.packages())` (the command from the code chunk above) and execute it by hitting *Enter* on your keyboard^[The `r ttcode("R")` session is initialized by clicking anywhere into the widget. This might take a few seconds. Just wait for the indicator next to the button *Run* to turn green]. 

As you might have noticed, there are some out-commented lines in the widget that ask you to assign a numeric value to a variable and then to print the variable's content to the console. You may enter your solution approach to `r ttcode("script.R")` and hit the button *Run* in order to get the feedback described further above. In case you do not know how to solve this sample exercise (don't panic, that is probably why you are reading this), a click on *Hint* will prompt you with some advice. If you still can't find a solution, a click on *solution* will provide you with another tab, `r ttcode("Solution.R")` which contains sample solution code. It will often be the case that exercises can be solved in many different ways and `r ttcode("Solution.R")` presents what we consider as comprehensible and idiomatic.

#### Conventions Used in this Book {-}

+ *Italic* text indicates new terms, names, buttons and alike.

+ `r ttcode("Constant width text")`, is generally used in paragraphs to refer to `r ttcode("R")` code. This includes commands, variables, functions, data types, databases and file names. 

+ <code>Constant width text on gray background</code> is used to indicate `r ttcode("R")` code that can be typed literally by you. It may appear in paragraphs for better distinguishability among executable and non-executable code statements but it will mostly be encountered in shape of large blocks of `r ttcode("R")` code. These blocks are referred to as code chunks (see above).

## A Very Short Introduction to `r ttcode("R")` and *RStudio*

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="RStudio: the four panes"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/rstudio.jpg')
```

#### `r ttcode("R")` Basics {-}

This section is meant for those who have never worked with `r ttcode("R")` or *RStudio*. If you at least know how to create objects and call functions, you can skip it. If you would like to refresh your memories or get a feeling for how to work with *RStudio*, keep reading.

First of all start *RStudio* and create a new R Script by selecting *File*, *New File*, *R Script*. In the editor pane type

```{r, eval = F}
1 + 1
```

and click on the button labeled *Run* in the top right corner of the editor. By doing so, your line of code is send to the console and the result of this operation should be displayed right underneath it. As you can see, `r ttcode("R")` works just like a calculator. You can do all the arithmetic calculations by using the corresponding operator (+, - , *, / or ^). If you are not sure what the last operator does, try it out and check the results.

#### Vectors {-}

`r ttcode("R")` is of course more sophisticated than that. We can work with variables or more generally objects. Objects are defined by using the assignment operator `r ttcode("<-")`. To create a variable named `r ttcode("x")` which contains the value `r ttcode("10")` type `x <- 10` and click the button *Run* yet again. The new variable should have appeared in the environment pane on the top right. The console however did not show any results, because our line of code did not contain any call that creates output. When you now type `x` in the console and hit return, you ask `r ttcode("R")` to show you the value of `r ttcode("x")` and the corresponding value should be printed in the console.

`r ttcode("x")` is a scalar, a vector of length $1$. You can easily create longer vectors by using the function `c()` (*c* for "concatenate" or "combine"). To create a vector `r ttcode("y")` containing the numbers $1$ to $5$ and print it, do the following.

```{r, eval = T}
y <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y
```

You can also create a vector of letters or words. For now just remember that characters have to be surrounded by quotes, else wise they will be parsed as object names.

```{r, eval = F}
hello <- c("Hello", "World")
```

Here we have created a vector of length 2 containing the words `r ttcode("Hello")` and `r ttcode("World")`. 

Do not forget to save your script! To do so, select *File*, *Save*.

#### Functions {-}

You have seen the function `r ttcode("c()")` that can be used to combine objects. In general, function calls look all the same, a function name is always followed by round parentheses. Sometimes, the parentheses include arguments

Here are two simple examples.

```{r, eval = T}
z <- seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 1)

mean(x = z)
```

In the first line we use a function called `r ttcode("seq")` to create the exact same vector as we did in the previous section but naming it `r ttcode("z")`. The function takes on the arguments `r ttcode("from")`, `r ttcode("to")` and `r ttcode("by")` which should be self-explaining.
The function `r ttcode("mean()")` computes the arithmetic mean of its argument `r ttcode("x")`. Since we pass the vector `r ttcode("z")` as the argument `r ttcode("x")` to `r ttcode("mean()")`, the result is `r ttcode("3")`!

If you are not sure what argument a function expects you may consult the function's documentation. Let's say we are not sure how the arguments required for `r ttcode("seq()")` work. Then we can type `?seq` in the console and by hitting return the documentation page for that function pops up in the lower right pane of *RStudio*. In there, the section *Arguments* holds the information we seek.

On the bottom of almost every help page you find examples on how to use the corresponding functions. This is very helpful for beginners and we recommend to look out for those.
